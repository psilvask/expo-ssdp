## Installation

```sh
npm install expo-ssdp
```

### Vanilla React Native Usage (Without Expo)

Yes! `expo-ssdp` is built using the modern **Expo Modules API**, which works seamlessly in **vanilla React Native** projects. You do not need to boot or use the Expo CLI or Expo SDK.

To configure your vanilla React Native project to run Expo Modules, simply run:

```sh
npx install-expo-modules@latest
```

This single command will automatically configure your native Android and iOS folders to support the lightweight Expo Modules compilation layer. Once configured, you can use `expo-ssdp` exactly like any other React Native library.

### Native Installation & Setup

### iOS

```sh
npx pod-install
```

The module depends on [CocoaAsyncSocket](https://github.com/robbiehanson/CocoaAsyncSocket) for robust UDP socket management on iOS. This is installed automatically via CocoaPods.

### Android

No extra steps. The module uses Android's standard `java.net.DatagramSocket` APIs.

### Permissions


#### iOS

On **physical devices (iOS 14+)**, UDP multicast requires two things. **Without both, `search()` silently returns an empty array on real hardware** — the Simulator is unaffected, so this will not surface in development.

**1. Add `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` to your app's `Info.plist`:**

```xml
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Used to discover devices on your local network.</string>
```

**2. Request and add the Multicast Networking Entitlement:**

The `com.apple.developer.networking.multicast` entitlement is a **restricted entitlement** that must be requested from Apple:

1. Submit a request at [developer.apple.com/contact/request/networking-multicast](https://developer.apple.com/contact/request/networking-multicast)
2. Once approved, add it to your `.entitlements` file:

```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.networking.multicast</key>
<true/>
```

3. Enable it under **Xcode → Signing & Capabilities → + Capability → Multicast Networking**.

> **Note:** This entitlement is free but requires Apple approval (typically a few days for legitimate device-discovery use cases).

#### Android

No manual steps needed — the library's `AndroidManifest.xml` automatically merges the required permissions into your app:

- `android.permission.INTERNET`
- `android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE` (required to enable multicast on Wi-Fi)

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { search } from 'expo-ssdp';

const devices = await search();

devices.forEach(device => {
  console.log(device.address);   // "192.168.1.42"
  console.log(device.location);  // "http://192.168.1.42:1400/xml/device_description.xml"
  console.log(device.usn);       // "uuid:550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000::upnp:rootdevice"
  console.log(device.server);    // "Linux/4.4.0 UPnP/1.1 MiniDLNA/1.3.0"
});
```

## API Reference

### `search(options?)`

Performs an active SSDP M-SEARCH on the local network and resolves with a list of discovered devices.

```typescript
import { search, SearchTargets } from 'expo-ssdp';

const devices = await search({
  searchTargets: [SearchTargets.MEDIA_RENDERER, SearchTargets.DIAL],
  timeoutMs: 8000,
  mx: 3,
  repeatProbe: true,
});
```

#### Options

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `searchTargets` | `string[]` | `["ssdp:all"]` | List of SSDP Search Target (ST) values. Each entry generates a separate M-SEARCH probe. |
| `timeoutMs` | `number` | `5000` | Total scan duration in milliseconds. The socket stays open for this duration to collect responses. |
| `mx` | `number` | `3` | MX (Maximum Wait) header in seconds. Devices may delay their response up to this value. Higher values reduce UDP collisions on busy networks. |
| `repeatProbe` | `boolean` | `true` | If true, a second probe burst is sent halfway through `timeoutMs`. Improves reliability on lossy or mesh Wi-Fi. |

#### Returns: `Promise<SsdpDevice[]>`

Each device object contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `address` | `string` | The IPv4 address of the responding device. |
| `headers` | `Record<string, string>` | All HTTP-like SSDP response headers (stored with original casing **and** uppercased). |
| `location` | `string?` | The LOCATION header — typically a URL to the device's UPnP description XML. |
| `usn` | `string?` | The USN (Unique Service Name) — uniquely identifies the device or service. |
| `st` | `string?` | The ST header from the response — indicates the device/service type. |
| `server` | `string?` | The SERVER header — often contains OS and firmware info. |
| `raw` | `string` | The full, unparsed SSDP response string. |

> **Note:** Results are deduplicated by **USN** (Unique Service Name). When using `ssdp:all`, a single physical device may produce **multiple entries** — one per UPnP service it advertises (e.g., `MediaServer`, `ContentDirectory`, `rootdevice`). Use the UUID prefix before `::` in the `usn` field to group entries belonging to the same physical device. When querying a specific ST (e.g., `SearchTargets.MEDIA_SERVER`), each physical device typically appears once.

---

### `SearchTargets`

A set of pre-defined, commonly-used SSDP Search Target strings:

```typescript
import { SearchTargets } from 'expo-ssdp';

SearchTargets.ALL              // "ssdp:all" — discover everything
SearchTargets.ROOT_DEVICE      // "upnp:rootdevice"
SearchTargets.MEDIA_RENDERER   // "urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:MediaRenderer:1"
SearchTargets.MEDIA_SERVER     // "urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:MediaServer:1"
SearchTargets.DIAL             // "urn:dial-multiscreen-org:service:dial:1" (Chromecast)
SearchTargets.SAMSUNG_TV       // "urn:samsung.com:service:MultiScreenService:1"
SearchTargets.SAMSUNG_REMOTE   // "urn:samsung.com:device:RemoteControlReceiver:1"
SearchTargets.ROKU             // "urn:roku-com:service:ecp:1"
SearchTargets.SONOS            // "urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:ZonePlayer:1"
SearchTargets.HUE_BRIDGE       // "urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:Basic:1"
SearchTargets.INTERNET_GATEWAY // "urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:InternetGatewayDevice:1"
```

---

### `getNetworkInterfaces()`

Returns a list of active IPv4 network interface names on the device. Useful for debugging when discovery is not working.

```typescript
import { getNetworkInterfaces } from 'expo-ssdp';

const interfaces = await getNetworkInterfaces();
console.log(interfaces); // ["en0"] on iPhone over Wi-Fi
```

---

### `isAvailable`

A boolean indicating whether the native module is loaded. Useful for graceful fallback.

```typescript
import { isAvailable, search } from 'expo-ssdp';

if (!isAvailable) {
  console.warn('SSDP not available on this platform/build.');
  return;
}

const devices = await search();
```

### Real-Time Streaming Discovery

Use `searchStream` (an `AsyncGenerator`) to yield devices as they are found, which makes your user interface feel extremely responsive:

```typescript
import { searchStream } from 'expo-ssdp';

try {
  for await (const device of searchStream({ timeoutMs: 8000 })) {
    console.log('Discovered:', device.address, '-', device.server);
    // Update React state or UI list immediately!
  }
  console.log('Search complete!');
} catch (err) {
  console.error('Search failed:', err);
}
```

### Passive Live Monitoring

Instead of active querying, listen for unsolicited `NOTIFY` announcements sent by devices to automatically detect when they join (`ssdp:alive`) or leave (`ssdp:byebye`) the network:

```typescript
import { listenForNotifications } from 'expo-ssdp';

const subscription = listenForNotifications({
  onAlive: (event) => {
    console.log('Device online:', event.address, 'USN:', event.usn);
  },
  onByeBye: (event) => {
    console.log('Device offline:', event.address, 'USN:', event.usn);
  },
  onUpdate: (event) => {
    console.log('Device status changed:', event.address);
  },
  onError: (error) => {
    console.error('Notification socket error:', error);
  }
});

// Later, stop listening to free network sockets:
subscription.remove();
```

### Unicast M-SEARCH

Directly target specific device IPs to verify their status or bypass routers that completely block multicast and broadcast packets:

```typescript
import { search } from 'expo-ssdp';

const devices = await search({
  unicastTargets: ["192.168.1.50", "192.168.1.100"],
  timeoutMs: 3000,
});
```

### Fetch UPnP Device Details

After discovering a device with a `location` URL, fetch its UPnP description XML to parse the friendly model name, manufacturer, and nested services:

```typescript
const devices = await search({ searchTargets: [SearchTargets.ROOT_DEVICE] });

for (const device of devices) {
  if (device.location) {
    const response = await fetch(device.location);
    const xml = await response.text();
    console.log(`Device at ${device.address}:`, xml);
  }
}
```

## How SSDP Works

SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) is a UDP-based protocol defined as part of UPnP/DLNA. When you call `search()`, the module:

1. **Opens a UDP socket** and enables multicast and broadcast.
2. **Sends M-SEARCH packets** to both:
   - The SSDP multicast group: `239.255.255.250:1900`
   - The broadcast address: `255.255.255.255:1900` *(fallback for routers that block multicast)*
3. **Waits** for devices to respond (up to `timeoutMs` ms).
4. **Deduplicates** responses by **USN** (Unique Service Name) — each unique `USN` header value is one entry. A single physical device may return multiple entries when using `ssdp:all` (one per UPnP service). Fall back to IP address when no USN is present.
5. **Optionally re-probes** halfway through the timeout window to catch devices that missed the first probe (UDP is lossy).

### Why both multicast AND broadcast?

Many modern consumer routers and mesh systems drop or mishandle multicast traffic. The broadcast fallback ensures discovery still works on these networks.

### What is `mx`?

The `MX` header tells devices how long they may wait (in seconds) before sending their response. Without `MX`, every device on the network would respond instantly, flooding your UDP socket and causing packet loss. A reasonable `MX: 3` spreads 20 devices' responses over 3 seconds, greatly reducing collisions.

## Troubleshooting

**No devices found:**
- Ensure your phone is on the same Wi-Fi network as the target devices.
- Try increasing `timeoutMs` to `10000` or `15000`.
- Check that `CHANGE_WIFI_MULTICAST_STATE` is in your Android manifest.
- Call `getNetworkInterfaces()` to verify the device has an active Wi-Fi interface.
- Some corporate/enterprise Wi-Fi networks block multicast/broadcast entirely.

**Partial results:**
- Enable `repeatProbe: true` (the default) to catch devices that missed the first probe.
- Some devices only respond to specific `ST` values — try multiple `searchTargets` including `"ssdp:all"`.

**Different results on iOS vs Android:**
- iOS binds to every active network interface. Android uses the default interface only. This can cause differences in which multicast groups are joined.
